Each example leverages the vsphere-iso builder and includes the high performance vmxnet3 network adapter and VMware Paravirtual SCSI controller (since NVMe controller support has not been released yet for the vsphere-iso builder). Of note, the prerequisites and default variable values in the example definition files are oriented to a VMware Cloud on AWS software-defined datacenter (SDDC) , but these examples should also be usable in most VMware vSphere environments with little to no modifications required. Considerations \u00b6 The example definition files provide the minimum necessary configuration for demonstration purposes. These VM templates are not hardened or otherwise intended for production purposes as-is. Building production-grade VM templates is possible, but out of scope for this project. Since these are examples, the host-based firewall is disabled and unconfigured. Additionally, since the intended use case is VMware Cloud on AWS , the expectation is that the NSX-T gateway and distributed firewalls would be used instead. A timestamp is appended to the VM template name so that you know exactly when it was built, and to prevent name collisions for subsequent builds. The AWS CLI is installed to provide an example of installing a package during the provisioners phase, but it's not necessary. Considerations for the ubuntu-server VM template \u00b6 As of 2020-09-04, Canonical's new automated Ubuntu server installation system that leverages cloud-init configuration, Subiquity , is not interoperable with VMware's guest customization feature . VMware has an existing open source project for providing interoperability with cloud-init , but its currently incompatible with the Subiquity implementation and this issue is being tracked in issue #50 . If guest customization is a requirement for your environment, use the ubuntu-server-legacy template instead, which leverages the legacy debian-installer preseeding system. As of 2020-09-04, one oddity of the Ubuntu 20.04.01 version of Subiquity is that the nocloud-net datasource must be used in the boot_command when providing the user-data and meta-data files via virtual floppy disk. This is odd because the nocloud datasource should be used when these files are local, and the nocloud-net datasource should be used when they're remote. One Packer community discussion about this can be found here . Considerations for the windows-server VM template \u00b6 Sysprep (generalize) is not run at the end of the build because the expectation is that the security identity (SID) will be reset via the guest customization specification created in the prerequisites below. Chocolatey is installed for programmatically installing software packages, but its not necessary. The OpenSSH Server feature is installed as a remote management option for your VMs, but this isn't necessary either. Prerequisites \u00b6 VMware vSphere environment \u00b6 A VMware Cloud on AWS software-defined datacenter (SDDC) (or a vSphere cluster ) A network segment (or port group ) with DHCP and internet connectivity Note: If specific destinations and ports are needed for building outbound firewall policy, please refer to the definition files as these may change over time, and the definition files will always be authoritative. Packer installed in a location with the following connectivity: HTTPS (443/tcp) connectivity to vCenter SSH (22/tcp) connectivity to the target network segment listed above for communicating with the VM during the provisioners phase WinRM-HTTPS (5986/tcp) connectivity to the target network segment listed above for communicating with Windows VMs during the provisioners phase Sufficient storage capacity for storing the VM guest operating sytem installation ISO image files, as well as the VM templates' virtual hard disks and other files in your vSAN WorkloadDatastore (or a writeable datastore ) Note: As of 2020-08-24, the vsphere-iso builder supports content libraries as a source location for ISO files. This feature isn't well-documented yet, but was released as part of v1.6.2 . vCenter credentials with cloudadmin (or administrative ) rights Custom fine-grained permissions are possible, but beyond the scope of this project For Linux VM templates \u00b6 Create a Linux guest customization specification . For Windows VM templates \u00b6 Create a Windows guest customization specification that generates a new security identity (SID). On a Windows server or client where you have administrative rights... Download the latest Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (Windows ADK) . Note: Only the Deployment tools feature that includes the Windows System Image Manager (SIM) is necessary. Getting started \u00b6 Build preparation \u00b6 Download the ISO image files for the VM template(s) that you want to build: Examples: ubuntu-server ubuntu-server-legacy (legacy Debian installer) windows-server and VMware Tools 11.0.5 (or whichever version is appropriate for your vSphere cluster ) Upload the VM guest operating system installation ISO files to a directory/folder named ISO in the target datastore Create one or more .pkrvars.hcl variable definition files for defining values for variables that you want to persist between builds Example variable definition file for building an Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS VM template with the ubuntu-server-legacy.pkr.hcl definition file: # ./ubuntu-server-18-legacy.pkrvars.hcl # http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/18.04/release/ubuntu-18.04.5-server-amd64.iso iso_filename = \"ubuntu-18.04.5-server-amd64.iso\" vm_name = \"template-ubuntu-server-18.04-amd64-legacy\" Preparing to build the ubuntu-server VM template \u00b6 . \u251c\u2500\u2500 http/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 scripts/ \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 linux/ \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 awscli.sh \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 ubuntu-server/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 meta-data \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 user-data \u2514\u2500\u2500 ubuntu-server.pkr.hcl Note: The ./http/ubuntu-server/user-data and ./http/ubuntu-server/meta-data are the cloud-init configuration files that are used to provide all of the input necessary to build the VM template without manual intervention, and ./http/ubuntu-server/meta-data file is supposed to be empty.

Voila! You're done. Troubleshooting \u00b6 Please see Debugging Packer Builds . Next steps \u00b6 Deploy a VM from your new VM template(s) and apply your guest customization specification that you created in the prerequisites (except when building with the ubuntu-server definition files due to the guest customization issue mentioned above) Customize the definition files and build new VM templates. Start building all of your VM templates programmatically!
